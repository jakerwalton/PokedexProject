# The Interactive Pokedex!

### Built With

### What It Is
This is the first project I've created after 3 weeks of learning the fundamentals of software engineering. It's a fun interactive Pokédex that uses the PokeAPI to display base information of all 898 Pokémon! It is fully functional and I've left a good bit of room to come back later on and add more even more functionality if I choose to do so.
