# The Interactive Pokedex!

### Built With

- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **jQuery**
- **PokeAPI**
- **And Photoshop**

### What It Is
This is the first project I've created after 3 weeks of learning the fundamentals of software engineering. It's a fun, fully functional, interactive Pokédex that uses the PokeAPI to display base information of all 898 Pokémon!

### Down The Road
- Id like to add a keypad that can be used to search up pokémon by their ID number,
- Make it so the up and down buttons on the dpad will go through the list of pokémon,
- Add buttons to switch description screen to a stats screen.
- Make it fully functional on mobile,
